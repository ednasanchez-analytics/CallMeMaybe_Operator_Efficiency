# 📞 Operator Efficiency — CallMeMaybe Telecom

Business Intelligence project analyzing operator performance in a virtual telephony platform.  
The goal was to **identify underperforming operators** using KPIs such as missed calls %, wait time, and outbound activity.  
Interactive dashboards were built in **Tableau** to monitor trends and highlight operational inefficiencies.

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Detect operators with high missed calls rate and long wait times
- Compare operator activity on inbound vs. outbound calls
- Create BI dashboards to monitor KPIs in real time
- Use statistical testing to validate differences between efficient and inefficient operators

---

## 📊 Dashboards

- **Operator Efficiency Dashboard** → KPIs: missed calls, call duration, outbound calls  
- **Call Distribution Dashboard** → Histograms, internal vs external calls, daily peaks
